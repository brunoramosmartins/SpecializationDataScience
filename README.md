# Applied Data Science with Python

## Specialization by University of Michigan

This project is a collection of my work from the 5 courses in the "Applied Data Science with Python" specialization offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera. The specialization introduces learners to data science through the Python programming language, and covers topics such as statistical analysis, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis.
